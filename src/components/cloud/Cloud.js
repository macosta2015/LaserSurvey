                        By utilizing high-precision motors and lasers, we can accurately determine the placement of ground markings.
                        This eliminates the need for expensive GPS equipment and the services of a surveyor or engineer.
                        Furthermore, anyone can easily mark the desired location of the markings simply by painting along the laser beam.
