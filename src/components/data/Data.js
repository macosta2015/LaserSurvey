            Mine surveying involves the use of a costly GNSS system that is essential for tasks such as excavation, blasting, and land boundary determination.
            However, due to the limited availability of equipment, only one GPS pole is available and a single individual is trained in its operation, leading to delays and inefficiencies in the surveying process for everyone else involved.
