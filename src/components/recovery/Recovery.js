                        My name is Mario Acosta, and I am a Mechanical Engineer with a minor in Computer Science. Currently, I work as a process and mining engineer in Miami, Florida, where I oversee all surveying activities.

                        During my time in college, I built a web application that was adopted and utilized by the school. This startup experience equipped me with the skills and knowledge to identify areas where the mining/surveying industry could be improved.
